/**
 * [T-stall-echo-strip] Deterministic echo suppression for stall-resume retries.
 *
 * [StallResume] carries a verbatim tail of the already-shown text into the
 * retried request as a continuation seed. Echo-prone models restate that
 * seed before continuing, which duplicated the whole stretch on screen
 * (observed 2026-10-05 on 2.0.36: byte-identical restart at the seed's
 * first character, the second copy a superset that kept growing). The
 * "do not restate" instruction in the seed is advisory; this guard is
 * arithmetic and model-independent.
 *
 * Contract: [feed] receives the retried attempt's text deltas in order and
 * returns the part that may reach consumers. The stripper aligns incoming
 * bytes against the exact seed it was constructed with (the same tail
 * [StallResume.note] embeds, obtained via [StallResume.tail]):
 *
 *  - while the buffer agrees with the seed byte-for-byte it is buffered —
 *    the echo may still be growing, so nothing can be published yet;
 *  - the moment the buffer diverges from the seed (or outgrows it), the
 *    matched span is the echo: if it is at least [MIN_ECHO] chars it is
 *    dropped, everything after passes through, and the stripper resolves
 *    to plain pass-through for the rest of the stream;
 *  - a divergence before [MIN_ECHO] is treated as coincidence (the model
 *    simply did not echo) and the whole buffer passes through;
 *  - [flush] resolves any buffered remainder at stream end.
 *
 * Worst-case display latency equals the seed length (echo held back until
 * the divergence point); a no-echo resume diverges within the first few
 * bytes, so the common case costs almost nothing. A rewritten (non-verbatim)
 * echo diverges immediately and is intentionally left alone — that is not
 * the byte-identical duplication this guard exists for.
