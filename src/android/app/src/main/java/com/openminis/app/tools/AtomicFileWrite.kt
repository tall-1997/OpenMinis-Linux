/**
 * Serialises and verifies the two filesystem-mutating tools.
 *
 * ## The bug this fixes
 *
 * `FileEditTool` is a read-modify-write over the whole file with no locking:
 *
 * ```
 * val content = file.readText()   // v1
 * ... compute newContent ...
 * file.writeText(newContent)      // overwrites with v1+edit
 * ```
 *
 * Two edits running concurrently each read v1 and each write back their own
 * view of it, so the first edit is silently discarded — and BOTH calls return
 * success, because neither `writeText` threw. Callers that re-check the tree
 * afterwards see their change gone with no error anywhere in the log. The same
 * race swallows a `file_write` that lands while a `file_edit` is mid-flight.
 *
 * The tools already run in parallel (sub-agents, multi-tool turns), so this is
 * not hypothetical: it is the reported "reported success but nothing landed"
 * failure.
 *
 * ## What it does
 *
 *  1. **Per-path lock.** Every write to a given canonical path is serialised,
 *     so a read-modify-write can never interleave with another write to the
 *     same file. Different paths stay concurrent — locking globally would
 *     needlessly serialise independent sub-agents.
 *  2. **Post-write verification.** After the write the file is re-read from
 *     disk and compared against what was meant to be written. A short write,
 *     a shadowed FUSE view, or a full disk now returns an ERROR instead of a
 *     success the caller will act on.
 *  3. **Atomic replace.** Content is written to a sibling temp file and
 *     renamed over the target. `writeText` truncates in place, so a crash
 *     mid-write leaves a half-written file; rename makes the old-or-new
 *     choice atomic. The temp file is removed on every failure path.
 *
 * Append mode cannot use rename (it must build on the existing bytes), so it
 * is verified but not made atomic — that is a property of append, not an
 * omission.
