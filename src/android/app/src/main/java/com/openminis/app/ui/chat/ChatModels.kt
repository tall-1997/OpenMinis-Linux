/**
 * Per-message streaming snapshot — the high-frequency fields that
 * [ChatViewModel.updateAssistantMessage] used to write straight into
 * [ChatMessage] (and re-publish via the `messages` StateFlow on every
 * token). Splitting them off into a side-channel
 * ([ChatViewModel.streamingById]) keeps the `messages` reference stable
 * during a turn, so the ChatScreen top-level composable's reads
 * (`messages.any/.associate/.isNotEmpty/.lastOrNull`) don't recompose on
 * every token — only on message-level structural changes (new message,
 * delete, retry, etc.).
 *
 * Renderers that care about streaming content subscribe per-item; the
 * effective render value is `streamingById[id]?.content ?: message.content`
 * (and analogously for the other fields). At the end of a streaming turn
 * the side-channel is drained back into the canonical message and the
 * map entry is removed.
