/**
 * [T-thinking-ladder-shared] The ONE place a thinking level becomes a token budget.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Four providers drive thinking with a NUMERIC token budget rather than an
 * effort string: Gemini 2.5 (`thinkingBudget`), Qwen/DashScope
 * (`thinking_budget`), Anthropic legacy (`budget_tokens`) and the Zen free lane
 * (`max_completion_tokens`). Each grew its own hardcoded ladder, and each one
 * collapsed in the same way — the top rungs were pinned to the model's own
 * ceiling:
 *
 *     XHIGH, MAX, ULTRA -> <the model's max output tokens>
 *
 * so on any model whose capacity sits near that ceiling the three rungs sent
 * byte-identical numbers. The user drags a slider, the request does not change.
 * Live evidence from the device's own Zen free catalogue: of 9 configured
 * models, 4 (big-pickle, mimo-v2.5, mimo-v2.6, ling-3.1 — capacities 32000 /
 * 32768) had XHIGH/MAX/ULTRA all clipped to the same value. Absolute ladders
 * cannot fix this: a constant that is below one model's ceiling is above
 * another's.
 *
 * ## The fix
 *
 * Budgets are FRACTIONS OF THE MODEL'S OWN CAPACITY, so every level is
 * strictly increasing for every capacity. A ceiling still clips the result —
 * that is correct and unavoidable — but because the ladder is proportional the
 * clip only bites at the very top rung instead of eating the whole upper half
 * of the ladder.
 *
 * Fractions are deliberately NOT evenly spaced (1/7..6/7 would give a linear
 * ramp). Thinking cost grows superlinearly with depth, so the ladder doubles
 * early and tapers late — the same shape as the measured must-think behaviour
 * (on mimo-v2.6-flash-free, 82% of output tokens were reasoning).
 *
 * ## Contract
 *
 * For any `capacity >= 2 * floor` the returned budgets are:
 *   - STRICTLY increasing in [ThinkingLevel.rank]
 *   - each `< capacity` (so a downstream `minOf(..., capacity)` is a no-op and
 *     cannot collapse two rungs into one)
 *   - each `>= floor`
 *
 * Degenerate capacities below `2 * floor` cannot satisfy all three, and the
 * function degrades to an honest single value rather than emitting a fake
 * gradient — the picker is expected to have already hidden those rungs.
