/**
 * [T-android-delete-from-here] Delete [messageId] and every message after
 * it, leaving the conversation as it stood immediately before that turn.
 * Mirrors iOS `6717c0ab0`.
 *
 * Deliberately close to — but not the same as — [retryFromMessage]. Both
 * rewind the conversation to a point, so this reuses that method's DB
 * anchoring: walk the persisted rows counting only user messages that have
 * VISIBLE text, because the agent loop also persists synthetic
 * `<system-reminder>` user rows that never rendered a bubble. Counting
 * those would anchor the cut one turn too early and silently take an extra
 * exchange with it (the iOS retry-anchor fix, ported here already).
 *
 * The one deliberate difference is the cut point: retry keeps the target
 * user message and re-sends it, so it cuts at `sortOrder + 1`. Delete From
 * Here removes the target too, so it cuts at `sortOrder`. Off-by-one in
 * either direction is silent and destructive — one strands the message the
 * user asked to delete, the other eats the preceding turn.
 *
 * No stream is started and `_isStreaming` is never claimed: this is a pure
 * truncation. It is still refused while a turn is in flight, because
 * deleting rows out from under a live agent loop would leave
 * [agentHistory] describing messages that no longer exist.
